Activity Lifecycle:

The activity lifecycle represents the states that an activity can go through from the time it is created to the time it is destroyed. 
Here are the different states in the activity lifecycle:

onCreate(): 
This method is called when the activity is first created. 
This is where you would typically initialize your UI components and load any data needed for the activity.

onStart(): 
This method is called when the activity becomes visible to the user. 
At this point, the activity is in the foreground but not yet interactive.

onResume(): This method is called when the activity is in the foreground and ready to receive user input.

onPause(): 
This method is called when the activity is still visible but is no longer in the foreground.
This happens, for example, when a dialog or notification appears on top of the activity.

onStop(): 
This method is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.
At this point, the activity is in the background but still alive.

onDestroy(): 
This method is called when the activity is being destroyed. 
This is typically where you would release any resources that the activity is holding on to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here's what happens when an app returns to the foreground:

If the app has been completely stopped, the onCreate() method of the activity is called first.
If the activity is already created but has been stopped, the onRestart() method is called followed by onStart().
Finally, the onResume() method is called, indicating that the activity is now in the foreground and ready to receive user input.
It's worth noting that if the activity was not destroyed while the app was in the background, it will retain its previous state when it comes back into the foreground. However, if the system needs to reclaim memory while the app is in the background, it may destroy the activity, in which case the activity will need to be recreated when the app comes back into the foreground.

In summary, when an app returns from the background to the foreground, 
the activity that was in the foreground before the app went to the background will go through the onRestart(), onStart(), and onResume() methods.

The onDestroy() method for an activity is called when the activity is being destroyed, 
either because the user has explicitly closed the activity or because the system is reclaiming memory 
and has decided to destroy the activity to free up resources.

However, it's important to note that just because the onDestroy() method is called 
doesn't necessarily mean that the activity is completely gone from memory. 
If the user navigates back to the activity using the back button or some other navigation mechanism, 
the activity can be recreated and its state can be restored. This is because Android maintains a back stack of activities, which allows users to navigate back through the app's history.
So, while the onDestroy() method indicates that the activity is being destroyed, it doesn't necessarily mean that the activity and all of its resources are being completely removed from memory. It just means that the activity is no longer visible and can be destroyed at any time by the system if necessary.
